        <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 font-light leading-relaxed mb-8">
          Most consulting firms profit from extended engagements and billable
          hours. They have every incentive to let you pay for bad ideas,
          over-engineered solutions, and projects that drag on. We're different.
          Our success is tied to your outcomes, not our invoices. We'll tell you
          when an idea won't work, when you're overcomplicating things, and when
          you should stop throwing money at a problem. As founders, we're in the
          code, in the data, in the trenches—and we're honest about what
          actually works.
